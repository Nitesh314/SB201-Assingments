Q4/- What is auto wiring in Spring, how many types of Auto wiring are there in spring,
explain with an example.


   Auto wiring in spring=>
                          if the spring container onm its own details the dependencies implicitly and injecting 
                          them into the dependent bean is known as auto wiring;
                          
   there is 4 type of auto wiring in spring 
   
   1)no(by default)
   
   2)byName
   
   3)byType
   
   4)Constructor
   
   
  
  2)byName=> 
            in this strategy if the bean id attribute value 
            in applicationContext.xml match with the variable/property name of  a dependent bean
            then implicitly performs the setter injection in dependent bean it is know the auto wiring byName
            
            example=
            
            <bean id="aid" class="com.masai.A" autoWire="byName"/>


          in this strategy if the bean class type value in applicationContext.xml match with the property 
          of the class type is same then container implicitly inject the setter  injection in dependent bean is known as 
          auto wire byType
          
          example=
                      <bean id="aid" class="com.masai.A" autoWire="byType"/>
                     
             
  
   3)Constructor=>
                   in this strategy spring container uses constructor injection instead of setter injection dependency resolution
                   by max number of Constructor if Constructor are overloaded.
