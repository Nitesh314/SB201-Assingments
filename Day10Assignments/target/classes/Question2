Q2/- How many scopes are there for a Spring Bean, which is the default scope for a Spring
Bean? Explain with an example

spring Scope=>
             there are 4 scope for spring bean
             
            1)singleton scope(by default)
            
            2)Prototype scope
            
            3)request scope 
            
            4)session scope
            
 here request and session scope are use only in web app(spring -mvc module)
 
 
 singleton and prototype scope can be used in 
 both web and non-web application.
 
 
1)singleton scope=>
                   it is return same bean class object for all the getBean()n method call with the same bean.
                   
               Example=>
               
               when we write this line
               
               ApplicationContext ctx=new ClassPathApplicationContext("applicationContext.xml");
               
               A a1=ctx.getBean("aid",A.class); 
               
               A a2=ctx.getBean("aid",A.class);
               
               syso(a1==a2)//true
               
               because singleton use to object based when we call ctx.getBean() method 
               then it will create one A class object but when we return call A object then
               the before created object get by a2
               
            note=> here we when the object are same and id is same then its work if i change object and id then it get the false.
            
            
  2)prototype=>
              it return the separate bean class object for every getBean() method 
              it the same id also.
              
              in order to tell the container to put bean object
              in a prototype scope we need to use "Scope" attribute of the <bean> tag;
              
         <bean id="aid" class="com.masai.A" Scope="prototype">
