Q1/- What do you mean by the IOC, explain the life cycle of the Spring Bean.


ans=>
     IOC(Inversion of control)=>
                             when the dependency entity object not created inside dependent 
					         entity and it can be created outside of any entity,class or container
					         then  it know as Inversion of control(IOC)
					         
					    
					    
	Life cycle of spring bean=>
    
    Life cycle of spring bean is 5 stage;
    
    1)Does not exist.
    
    2)Instantiated
    
    3)Initialized
    
    4)Service
    
    5)Destory
    
    
 1)Does not exist=>
                   Initially a spring bean object does not exist, if thd bean object
                   is in singleton scope then bean
                   is instantiated by container at the time of loading the xml file.
                   
                    if the scope is prototype then it is instantiated at the time of pulling the 
                    object that object(at the time of calling the getBean() method ).
  
  2) Instantiated=>
                   Spring container loads the spring bean class into
                   the memory and creates the bean class object after 
                   that ten bean class object is created, spring container user id to popukated the bean files 
                   
                   all the dependencies will be resolved for a spring bean before its instantiated is 
                   finished
                   
                   
 3) Initialization phase=>
                         if inside the spring bean class any user-defined init-method is configured
                         spring container will call the method
                         
                         
 4)Services=>
             here spring container provides the bean object reference to the caller 
             then caller will call its business method on the bean object.
             
             
 5)Destory=>
            upon the container shutdown (when we call close() method on the container class )
            spring container will call user defined destory() method if it is configured just before bean instance is garbage collected.
