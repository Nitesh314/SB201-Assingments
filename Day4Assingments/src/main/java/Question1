Q1/- What are the limitations of EntityManager methods to perform CRUD operations with
     DB?


 ans=>
      there  are many limitations of performing operations using  EntityManager methods with
      DB
      
      EntityManager methods;
      
      1) persist();
      2)find();
      3)merge();
      4)remove();
      
   
   1) Retrieving Entity object based on only ID field means 
      we are retrieve the data only based on primary key;
      
   2)multiple Entity object retrieval is not possible using find() method
   
   3)bulk update and bulk delete is also not possible 
   
   4)to access Entity object we can not specify some extra condition;
