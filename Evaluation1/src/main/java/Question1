What are the advantages of using Hibernate over JDBC?

ans=>
      there are many advantages of using hibernate over JDBC
      
      1- Using hibernate we dont write and add dependency in the class path
      2- Using hibernate we dont write SQL query
      3- Hibernate support inheritance and association mapping.
           This is the major benefit of Hibernate over JDBC. In 
           JDBC there is no concept of inheritance or association mapping.
           In association mapping, it is easy to save and manage the entity. 
           For example, when we save parent entity the child entity
           will save automatically.
           
       4- Associate mapping can be done while using Hibernate.
          We can use associations like one to one and one to many 
          through annotations. This helps to manage the entity in an easier way.
