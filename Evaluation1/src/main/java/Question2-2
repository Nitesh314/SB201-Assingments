                                                        Detached State
                                                        
                                                            
 
 
    
1-New/Transient State:
                       if we create the object of persistence 
                       class and this is not attached with EntityManager 
                       object then this stage is known as new/Transient state 
                     
2-Persistence/managed State:
                            if we create the object of persistence class and this object 
                            is associated with EntityManager object then this stage is known as 
                            persistence State.
                            
                     example->
                              when we call the persist(-) and find(-,-) methods then by supplying and gating the Entity objects then this stage is known
                              persistence stage.
                              
-Detached state:
                when we use or call the close() or clear() method with the help of EntityManager then
                EntityManager release or get  all the Entity in Detached State
                
                when the Entity in Detached State then Entity not have synchronized with DB.
                
     EXAMPLE of ALl=>
      
      
      
      public class  DEMO{           
      
      public static void main(String[] args){
      
        EntityManagerFactory emf=Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory("employeeUnit");
		  
		EntityManager em=emf.createEntityManager();
		
		Employee employee=new Employee(,"Nitesh",50000); //	new/Transient state
		
		em.persist(employee)//persistence state
		
		em.close()//Detached State;
		
		}
	   }
