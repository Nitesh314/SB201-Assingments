Q1/- What is a Servlet ? What is the role of the DispatcherServlet in the Spring boot rest

Servlet:
A servlet is a Java-based, platform-independent component that is used to extend the 
capabilities of a web server. It can dynamically process and respond to client requests. 
Servlets are typically used in web applications to generate dynamic web content, handle 
user input, and interact with databases.

Servlets follow the Java Servlet API, which defines a standard interface for writing 
Java classes that respond to HTTP requests. Servlets can handle various HTTP methods 
(e.g., GET, POST) and are commonly used in Java-based web applications to manage the
