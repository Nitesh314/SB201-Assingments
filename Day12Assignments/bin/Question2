Q2/- What is the HTTP protocol, explain about the HTTP request and the HTTP response.


ans=>
     it is a protocol that contains set of rules and guidelines to get communication between
     http client(browser s/w) and web server or application server.
     
     
HTTP Request:
            An HTTP request is made by a client (such as a web browser) to 
            request a resource, like a web page or a file, from a web server. 
            A typical HTTP request consists of the following components:

Request Method: 
              This indicates the type of request being made, such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. 
              The most common method is GET, which is used to retrieve data.

Request URL (Uniform Resource Locator): 
              This is the URL of the resource the client wants to access.

HTTP Version: 
            It specifies the version of the HTTP protocol being used, like HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2.

Request Headers: 
            These are key-value pairs that provide additional information about the request. 
            Headers can include information about the client, the type of data it can accept, and more.

Request Body (Optional): 
            Some request methods, like POST or PUT, may include a request body. This is where 
            data, such as form data or a file to upload, is sent to the server.  


HTTP Response:-
             An HTTP response is sent by the web server to the client in 
             response to an HTTP request. It typically includes the following components:

Status Line: 
           This line contains an HTTP status code and a brief, human-readable 
           status message. The status code indicates whether the request was 
           successful, encountered an error, or needs further action.

Response Headers: 
                Similar to request headers, response headers provide additional 
                information about the server's response. They can include details 
                about the server, the type of content being sent, and more.

Response Body: 
               The response body contains the actual data that the client requested. 
               It could be an HTML web page, an image, a file, or any other type of data.
