Q1) Explain the Entity class life-cycle
 
 Ans=>
      An Entity object has 3 life-cycle state
      
      1)new State / Transient state
      
      2)persistence / managed state
      
      3)detached state
      

1) new State/Transient state : 
                               if we create the object 
   of persistence class and this class is not attached with EntityManager object
   then this state is known as new State/Transient State.


2)persistence/ managed state :
                               if we create the object of persistence class and this class is 
                               associated with EntityManager object then this state is known 
                               as persistence/ managed state
                               
              example=>
                       whenever we call .persist(.) method by passing student entity object at this time
                       student object will be in persistence state. 
                       
                       and if we call find(.,.) then this state is known as persistence state  
                       
                       inside persistence state entity object is synchronized with Db automatic
                                      
                                 
  
 3)detached state :
                  whenever we  close() or clear() method on the EntityManager object then all 
                  the associated entity object will be in detached state
                  
                  in this stage the entity object will not be synchronized with the DB table;
