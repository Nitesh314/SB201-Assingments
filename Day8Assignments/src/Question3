Q3/- What are the challenges of developing an Enterprise application?

  ans=> Developing enterprise applications can be a complex and challenging
        task due to the unique requirements and scale of these applications.
        Here are some of the common challenges faced by developers when building
        enterprise applications: 
        
       1) Security: Enterprise applications deal with sensitive data and
                  often need to adhere to strict security regulations.
                  Ensuring data security, authentication, authorization, 
                  and protection against vulnerabilities like SQL injection
                  and cross-site scripting is a significant challenge.
                  
       2)Complexity: Enterprise applications often need to handle complex business logic, 
                   data flows, and integrations with various systems. Managing this complexity 
                   can be challenging, especially as the application grows.

       3)Scalability: Enterprise applications must be able to scale horizontally and vertically 
                    to accommodate increased user loads and data volumes. Ensuring scalability 
                    without sacrificing performance can be difficult.
