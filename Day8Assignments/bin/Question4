Q4/- Write Short notes on how the Spring framework evolves.

ans=>he Spring framework is a popular and widely used 
     framework for building Java-based enterprise applications. 
     It has evolved over the years to meet the changing 
     needs of developers and the evolving landscape of 
     enterprise software development. Here are some short 
     notes on how the Spring framework has evolved:
     
     Inception (2002): The Spring framework was created by Rod Johnson and first 
     released in 2002. It was designed to address the complexities and challenges 
     of Java EE (Enterprise Edition) development. The initial release focused on 
     providing a lightweight and non-intrusive alternative to Java EE.
     
     IoC Container (Inversion of Control): The core concept of Spring is the IoC 
     container, which allows developers to manage and configure application 
     components and their dependencies. The framework's early versions primarily 
     revolved around this container.
