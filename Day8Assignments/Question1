Q1/- Wht is the J2EE, list out some of the Application Server names.

   ANS=>
        Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition (J2EE) is a set of 
        specifications, APIs (Application Programming Interfaces),
        and technologies for building enterprise-level applications
        using the Java programming language. It provides a standardized
        way to develop, deploy, and manage large-scale, distributed,
        and multi-tiered Java applications.
        
        Some of the key features and components of J2EE include:
        
       
       1 Servlets: Servlets are Java programs that run on a web
         server and handle HTTP requests and responses. They are
         used for building web applications.

	   2 JSP (JavaServer Pages): JSP is a technology for creating
	     dynamic web pages using Java. It allows embedding Java code
	     within HTML pages to generate dynamic content.
		
	   3 EJB (Enterprise JavaBeans): EJB is a component model for
	     building enterprise-level, server-side applications. 
	     It provides features like transaction management, security, and scalability.
		
	   4 JMS (Java Message Service): JMS is a messaging standard for building
	     distributed and loosely coupled applications. It allows applications
	     to exchange messages asynchronously.
		
	   5 JTA (Java Transaction API): JTA is an API for managing
	     distributed transactions in Java applications.
		
	   6 JDBC (Java Database Connectivity): JDBC is used for database connectivity and allows Java applications to interact with relational databases.
		
	   7 JNDI (Java Naming and Directory Interface): JNDI
	     provides a naming and directory service for Java
	     applications, allowing them to look up resources
	     like database connections and EJB components
