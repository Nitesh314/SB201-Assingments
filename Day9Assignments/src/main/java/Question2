Q2/- Explain about IOC and Dependency Injection

   IOC =>
         when the dependency entity object not created inside dependent 
         entity and it can be created outside of any entity,class or container
         then  it know as Inversion of control(IOC)
         
   
   Dependency Injection=>
                        Here external entity will push the dependency object to the dependent clss
                        (configuring the object inside some container and the container will push the 
                        dependency object to the dependent class)
